RuneScape-Mobile
================

Stream live footage to your Android-Powered device!

RuneScape Mobile will let you stream live snapshots from PowerBot to any Android-Powered device in your local network.
Think about mobile phones, tablets, OUYA, Android SmartTV's, and more!

How to.
Inject the script in your PowerBot client and start the script.
You can find the 2 .java files in the src folder.

1. Give in the IP Address.
2. Give in the port.
3. Give in the scale.
4. Waiting for connection.

Now, install the apk on your android device and run the app. (Install with a file manager like Astro, ...)
Select Settings, and give in the IP address to connect with from the server. (The PowerBot client.)
Also give in the port number. (Default is 10130)

MAKE SURE YOUR DEVICE IS ON THE SAME NETWORK! (WIFI is turned on)

Now go back to the main menu, swipe from left edge to the right, and a menu will appear.
Tap on Login, and you're good to go.

Note* If you do not trust this, please login with the script rather then logging in manually.
